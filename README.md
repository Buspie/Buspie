- Happy to code, eager to learn. And above all that - have fun.
  
- 👀 I’m interested in ...
- As silly as that sounds... not cybersec. Not even Python.
- I'm here to Java it up. Fell in love with it somewhat shy of 6 months ago, when I decided to switch my careers. But that is a long story for another time.
  
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ...
- Spring Security. Nuff said, I believe.
  
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ...
- Any open source Java/Spring projects that will boost my mastery over this beautiful language.
  
- 📫 How to reach me ...
- Hit me up on GitHub or Discord @Busington

- 😄 Pronouns: ... :)
  
- ⚡ Fun fact: ...
- I'm an avid guinea pigs and canine lover. Been working with nearby shelter for past 5 years.
- I've seen -one- movie by David Lynch, Lost Highway, after being basically dragged to it by my better half. Never gone to cinema since.
